# MachineLearning

In this repository, I will showcase my application of Machine Learning through coursework assignments at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information.

This work focuses on practical applications in cybersecurity. It showcases key concepts and techniques learned through lectures and projects, using Python and popular libraries (NumPy, scikit-learn, etc.) to tackle problems like anomaly detection and malware analysis. The work emphasizes hands-on learning and building intuition, but assumes some background in probability, statistics, and linear algebra. The goal is to showcase the following learning outcomes:

- Understanding of a variety of machine learning concepts, especially neural networks.
- Application of machine learning techniques to new cybersecurity problems.
- Use of Python and common libraries for machine learning tasks.
- Independent learning of new machine learning tools and approaches.
- Evaluation and implemention of basic machine learning solutions for security.
